[Appendix E. ]{.label}Other Popular ANN Architectures
=====================================================

In this appendix I will give a quick overview of a few historically
important neural network architectures that are much less used today
than deep Multilayer Perceptrons
([Chapter 10](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-machine-learning/9781492032632/ch10.html#ann_chapter)),
convolutional neural networks
([Chapter 14](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-machine-learning/9781492032632/ch14.html#cnn_chapter)),
recurrent neural networks
([Chapter 15](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-machine-learning/9781492032632/ch15.html#rnn_chapter)),
or autoencoders
([Chapter 17](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-machine-learning/9781492032632/ch17.html#autoencoders_chapter)).
They are often mentioned in the literature, and some are still used in a
range of applications, so it is worth knowing about them. Additionally,
we will discuss *deep belief nets*, which were the state of the art in
Deep Learning until the early 2010s. They are still the subject of very
active research, so they may well come back with a vengeance in the
future.



Hopfield Networks
=================

*Hopfield networks* were[]{#idm45728430736456}[]{#idm45728430735480}
first introduced by W. A. Little in 1974, then popularized by J.
Hopfield in 1982. They[]{#idm45728430734568} are *associative memory*
networks: you first teach them some patterns, and then when they see a
new pattern they (hopefully) output the closest learned pattern. This
made them useful for character recognition, in particular, before they
were outperformed by other approaches: you first train the network by
showing it examples of character images (each binary pixel maps to one
neuron), and then when you show it a new character image, after a few
iterations it outputs the closest learned character.

Hopfield networks are fully connected graphs (see
[Figure E-1](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-machine-learning/9781492032632/app05.html#hopfield_net_diagram));
that is, every neuron is connected to every other neuron. Note that in
the diagram the images are 6 × 6 pixels, so the neural network on the
left should contain 36 neurons (and 630 connections), but for visual
clarity a much smaller network is represented.

![](./E_files/mls2_ae01.png)

The training algorithm works by using Hebb's rule (see ["The
Perceptron"](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-machine-learning/9781492032632/ch10.html#theperceptron)):
for each training image, the weight between two neurons is increased if
the corresponding pixels are both on or both off, but decreased if one
pixel is on and the other is off.

To show a new image to the network, you just activate the neurons that
correspond to active pixels. The network then computes the output of
every neuron, and this gives you a new image. You can then take this new
image and repeat the whole process. After a while, the network reaches a
stable state. Generally, this corresponds to the training image that
most resembles the input image.

A so-called *energy function* is[]{#idm45728430725896} associated with
Hopfield nets. At each iteration, the energy decreases, so the network
is guaranteed to eventually stabilize to a low-energy state. The
training algorithm tweaks the weights in a way that decreases the energy
level of the training patterns, so the network is likely to stabilize in
one of these low-energy configurations. Unfortunately, some patterns
that were not in the training set also end up with low energy, so the
network sometimes stabilizes in a configuration that was not learned.
These[]{#idm45728430724504} are called *spurious patterns*.

Another major flaw with Hopfield nets is that they don't scale very
well---their memory capacity is roughly equal to 14% of the number of
neurons. For example, to classify 28 × 28--pixel images, you would need
a Hopfield net with 784 fully connected neurons and 306,936 weights.
Such a network would only be able to learn about 110 different
characters (14% of 784). That's a lot of parameters for such a small
memory.




Boltzmann Machines
==================

*Boltzmann machines*
were[]{#idm45728430720088}[]{#idm45728430719112}[]{#idm45728430718440}[]{#idm45728430717768}
invented in 1985 by Geoffrey Hinton and Terrence Sejnowski. Just like
Hopfield nets, they are fully connected ANNs, but they are based on
*stochastic neurons*: instead of using a deterministic step function to
decide what value to output, these neurons output 1 with some
probability, and 0 otherwise. The probability function that these ANNs
use is based on the Boltzmann distribution (used in statistical
mechanics), hence their name. [Equation
E-1](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-machine-learning/9781492032632/app05.html#boltzmann_distribution_equation)
gives the probability that a particular neuron will output 1.


##### [Equation E-1. ]{.label}Probability that the i^th^ neuron will output 1

$$p\left( {s_{i}^{(\text{next}\text{step})} = 1} \right)\, = \,\sigma\left( \frac{\sum\limits_{j = 1}^{N}{w_{i,j}s_{j} + b_{i}}}{T} \right)$$


-   *s*~*j*~ is the *j*^th^ neuron's state (0 or 1).

-   *w*~*i*,*j*~ is the connection weight between the *i*^th^ and
    *j*^th^ neurons. Note that *w*~*i*,*i*~ = 0.

-   *b*~*i*~ is the *i*^th^ neuron's bias term. We can implement this
    term by adding a bias neuron to the network.

-   *N* is the number of neurons in the network.

-   *T* is a[]{#idm45728430681336} number called the network's
    *temperature*; the higher the temperature, the more random the
    output is (i.e., the more the probability approaches 50%).

-   *σ* is the logistic function.

Neurons[]{#idm45728430677992}[]{#idm45728430677256} in Boltzmann
machines are separated into two groups: *visible units* and *hidden
units* (see
[Figure E-2](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-machine-learning/9781492032632/app05.html#boltzmann_machine_diagram)).
All neurons work in the same stochastic way, but the visible units are
the ones that receive the inputs and from which outputs are read.

Because of its stochastic nature, a Boltzmann machine will never
stabilize into a fixed configuration; instead, it will keep switching
between many configurations. If it is left running for a sufficiently
long time, the probability of observing a particular configuration will
only be a function of the connection weights and bias terms, not of the
original configuration (similarly, after you shuffle a deck of cards for
long enough, the configuration of the deck does not depend on the
initial state). When the network reaches this state where the original
configuration is "forgotten," it is[]{#idm45728430673576} said to be in
*thermal equilibrium* (although its configuration keeps changing all the
time). By setting the network parameters appropriately, letting the
network reach thermal equilibrium, and then observing its state, we can
simulate a wide range of probability distributions.
This[]{#idm45728430672056} is called a *generative model*.

![](./E_files/mls2_ae02.png)

Training a Boltzmann machine means finding the parameters that will make
the network approximate the training set's probability distribution. For
example, if there are three visible neurons and the training set
contains 75% (0, 1, 1) triplets, 10% (0, 0, 1) triplets, and 15% (1, 1,
1) triplets, then after training a Boltzmann machine, you could use it
to generate random binary triplets with about the same probability
distribution. For example, about 75% of the time it would output the (0,
1, 1) triplet.

Such a generative model can be used in a variety of ways. For example,
if it is trained on images, and you provide an incomplete or noisy image
to the network, it will automatically "repair" the image in a reasonable
way. You can also use a generative model for classification. Just add a
few visible neurons to encode the training image's class (e.g., add 10
visible neurons and turn on only the fifth neuron when the training
image represents a 5). Then, when given a new image, the network will
automatically turn on the appropriate visible neurons, indicating the
image's class (e.g., it will turn on the fifth visible neuron if the
image represents a 5).

Unfortunately, there is no efficient technique to train Boltzmann
machines. However, fairly efficient algorithms have been developed to
train *restricted Boltzmann machines* (RBMs).




Restricted Boltzmann Machines
=============================

An[]{#idm45728430663992}[]{#idm45728430662904} RBM is simply a Boltzmann
machine in which there are no connections between visible units or
between hidden units, only between visible and hidden units. For
example,
[Figure E-3](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-machine-learning/9781492032632/app05.html#rbm_diagram)
represents an RBM with three visible units and four hidden units.

![](./E_files/mls2_ae03.png)

A[]{#idm45728430658392} very efficient training algorithm called
*Contrastive Divergence* was [introduced in 2005 by Miguel Á.
Carreira-Perpiñán and Geoffrey
Hinton](https://homl.info/135).^[1](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-machine-learning/9781492032632/app05.html#idm45728430655976){#idm45728430655976-marker
.totri-footnote}^ Here is how it works: for each training instance
**x**, the algorithm starts by feeding it to the network by setting the
state of the visible units to *x*~1~, *x*~2~, ⋯, *x*~*n*~. Then you
compute the state of the hidden units by applying the stochastic
equation described before ([Equation
E-1](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-machine-learning/9781492032632/app05.html#boltzmann_distribution_equation)).
This gives you a hidden vector **h** (where *h*~*i*~ is equal to the
state of the *i*^th^ unit). Next you compute the state of the visible
units, by applying the same stochastic equation. This gives you a vector
**x**ʹ. Then once again you compute the state of the hidden units, which
gives you a vector **h**ʹ. Now you can update each connection weight by
applying the rule in [Equation
E-2](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-machine-learning/9781492032632/app05.html#contrastive_divergence),
where *η* is the learning rate.


##### [Equation E-2. ]{.label}Contrastive divergence weight update

$\left. w_{i,j}\leftarrow w_{i,j} + \eta\,\left( \mathbf{x}\mathbf{h}^{\intercal} - \mathbf{x}'\mathbf{h}'^{\intercal} \right) \right.$


The great benefit of this algorithm is that it does not require waiting
for the network to reach thermal equilibrium: it just goes forward,
backward, and forward again, and that's it. This makes it incomparably
more efficient than previous algorithms, and it was a key ingredient to
the first success of Deep Learning based on multiple stacked RBMs.




Deep Belief Nets
================

Several[]{#idm45728430634664} layers of RBMs can be stacked; the hidden
units of the first-level RBM serve as the visible units for the
second-layer RBM, and so on. Such an RBM stack is called a *deep belief
net* (DBN).

Yee-Whye Teh, one of Geoffrey Hinton's students, observed that it was
possible to train DBNs one layer at a time using Contrastive Divergence,
starting with the lower layers and then gradually moving up to the top
layers. This led to the [groundbreaking article that kickstarted the
Deep Learning tsunami in
2006](https://homl.info/136).^[2](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-machine-learning/9781492032632/app05.html#idm45728430631880){#idm45728430631880-marker
.totri-footnote}^

Just like RBMs, DBNs learn to reproduce the probability distribution of
their inputs, without any supervision. However, they are much better at
it, for the same reason that deep neural networks are more powerful than
shallow ones: real-world data is often organized in hierarchical
patterns, and DBNs take advantage of that. Their lower layers learn
low-level features in the input data, while higher layers learn
high-level [features]{.keep-together}.

Just like RBMs, DBNs are fundamentally unsupervised, but you can also
train them in a supervised manner by adding some visible units to
represent the labels. Moreover, one great feature of DBNs is that they
can be trained in a semisupervised fashion.
[Figure E-4](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-machine-learning/9781492032632/app05.html#dbn_diagram)
represents such a DBN configured for semisupervised learning.

![](./E_files/mls2_ae04.png)

First, RBM 1 is trained without supervision. It learns low-level
features in the training data. Then RBM 2 is trained with RBM 1's hidden
units as inputs, again without supervision: it learns higher-level
features (note that RBM 2's hidden units include only the three
rightmost units, not the label units). Several more RBMs could be
stacked this way, but you get the idea. So far, training was 100%
unsupervised. Lastly, RBM 3 is trained using RBM 2's hidden units as
inputs, as well as extra visible units used to represent the target
labels (e.g., a one-hot vector representing the instance class). It
learns to associate high-level features with training labels. This is
the supervised step.

At the end of training, if you feed RBM 1 a new instance, the signal
will propagate up to RBM 2, then up to the top of RBM 3, and then back
down to the label units; hopefully, the appropriate label will light up.
This is how a DBN can be used for [classification]{.keep-together}.

One great benefit of this semisupervised approach is that you don't need
much labeled training data. If the unsupervised RBMs do a good enough
job, then only a small amount of labeled training instances per class
will be necessary. Similarly, a baby learns to recognize objects without
supervision, so when you point to a chair and say "chair," the baby can
associate the word "chair" with the class of objects it has already
learned to recognize on its own. You don't need to point to every single
chair and say "chair"; only a few examples will suffice (just enough so
the baby can be sure that you are indeed referring to the chair, not to
its color or one of the chair's parts).

Quite amazingly, DBNs can also work in reverse. If you activate one of
the label units, the signal will propagate up to the hidden units of RBM
3, then down to RBM 2, and then RBM 1, and a new instance will be output
by the visible units of RBM 1. This new instance will usually look like
a regular instance of the class whose label unit you activated. This
generative capability of DBNs is quite powerful. For example, it has
been used to automatically generate captions for images, and vice versa:
first a DBN is trained (without supervision) to learn features in
images, and another DBN is trained (again without supervision) to learn
features in sets of captions (e.g., "car" often comes with
"automobile"). Then an RBM is stacked on top of both DBNs and trained
with a set of images along with their captions; it learns to associate
high-level features in images with high-level features in captions.
Next, if you feed the image DBN an image of a car, the signal will
propagate through the network, up to the top-level RBM, and back down to
the bottom of the caption DBN, producing a caption. Due to the
stochastic nature of RBMs and DBNs, the caption will keep changing
randomly, but it will generally be appropriate for the image. If you
generate a few hundred captions, the most frequently generated ones will
likely be a good description of the
image.^[3](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-machine-learning/9781492032632/app05.html#idm45728430620168){#idm45728430620168-marker
.totri-footnote}^




Self-Organizing Maps
====================

*Self-organizing maps* (SOMs)
are[]{#idm45728430616616}[]{#idm45728430615576} quite different from all
the other types of neural networks we have discussed so far. They are
used to produce a low-dimensional representation of a high-dimensional
dataset, generally for visualization, clustering, or classification. The
neurons are spread across a map (typically 2D for visualization, but it
can be any number of dimensions you want), as shown in
[Figure E-5](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-machine-learning/9781492032632/app05.html#som_diagram),
and each neuron has a weighted connection to every input (note that the
diagram shows just two inputs, but there are typically a very large
number, since the whole point of SOMs is to reduce dimensionality).

![](./E_files/mls2_ae05.png)

Once the network is trained, you can feed it a new instance and this
will activate only one neuron (i.e., one point on the map): the neuron
whose weight vector is closest to the input vector. In general,
instances that are nearby in the original input space will activate
neurons that are nearby on the map. This makes SOMs useful not only for
visualization (in particular, you can easily identify clusters on the
map), but also for applications like speech recognition. For example, if
each instance represents an audio recording of a person pronouncing a
vowel, then different pronunciations of the vowel "a" will activate
neurons in the same area of the map, while instances of the vowel "e"
will activate neurons in another area, and intermediate sounds will
generally activate intermediate neurons on the map.


###### Note

One important difference from the other dimensionality reduction
techniques discussed in
[Chapter 8](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-machine-learning/9781492032632/ch08.html#dimensionality_chapter)
is that all instances get mapped to a discrete number of points in the
low-dimensional space (one point per neuron). When there are very few
neurons, this technique is better described as clustering rather than
dimensionality reduction.


The training algorithm is unsupervised. It works by having all the
neurons compete against each other. First, all the weights are
initialized randomly. Then a training instance is picked randomly and
fed to the network. All neurons compute the distance between their
weight vector and the input vector (this is very different from the
artificial neurons we have seen so far). The neuron that measures the
smallest distance wins and tweaks its weight vector to be slightly
closer to the input vector, making it more likely to win future
competitions for other inputs similar to this one. It also recruits its
neighboring neurons, and they too update their weight vectors to be
slightly closer to the input vector (but they don't update their weights
as much as the winning neuron). Then the algorithm picks another
training instance and repeats the process, again and again. This
algorithm tends to make nearby neurons gradually specialize in similar
inputs.^[4](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-machine-learning/9781492032632/app05.html#idm45728430606136){#idm45728430606136-marker

You can imagine a class of young children with roughly similar skills.
One child happens to be slightly better at basketball. This motivates
them to practice more, especially with their friends. After a while,
this group of friends gets so good at basketball that other kids cannot
compete. But that's okay, because the other kids specialize in other
areas. After a while, the class is full of little specialized groups.
